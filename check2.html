			<p>Arduino-Based Energy Meter
				The Arduino based energy meter consists of an Arduino Uno board, current sensor, voltage sensor, relay, GSM module, LCD screen and AC/DC power supply.
				An AC to DC power supply is used to convert the AC power to a DC power to power the system. The voltage sensor measures the voltage of the source while the current sensor measures the power consumption. A microcontroller embedded onto the Arduino Uno board analyse and interpret the information it receives from the current and voltage sensor and compute the corresponding energy consumed. The computed energy and other variables would be displayed by the LCD screen. The purpose of the relay is to control the supply of power to the consumer. The GSM module is to ensure the connection between the meter and a server for communication.

			<h2 class="heading mobile">Mobile App</h2>
			<p>
				The android mobile application has been designed to provide a functional and easy-to-use tool to the energy consumers to monitor, manage and control the energy meter, and also pay their energy bills. The application was developed using Android Studio and Android software development kit (SDK) and Kotlin programming.
				The graphical interface consisted of the meter management menu, the make payment menu, view consumption menu, monitor consumption menu, make complaints menu and notifications menu.
				The meter management menu is designed to help the consumer add meter to the system and also delete meter from the application, switch to a particular meter in the case of consumers having multiple meters and also switch between consumer modes; either from prepaid to postpaid or vice versa provided the necessary requirement are met.

				<h2 class="heading web">Web App</h2>
				<p>
				The web application was also developed to provide energy providers with a functional and easy-to-use tool to manage, monitor and control energy meters remotely. 
				The web application was developed using React Js. ReactJS is a component-based library that is deployed for interactive user interface creation. Nowadays it is the most popular JS front-end library. It is supported by Facebook, Instagram and individual developers and organisationsâ€™ community. React effectively allows for the creation of broad and complex web-based applications that can adjust their data without refreshing the page afterward. It aims at delivering better user experience and the development of fast and robust web apps (Aggarwal, 2018). 
				The web application designed allows energy providers to add or register a meter. Apart from the consumer information needed to register a meter, the consumer has to choose which consumer mode he would prefer; either prepaid or postpaid. The application also aids providers to view individual meter consumption, control meter remotely and view payment details of consumers.
